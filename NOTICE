NOTICE: Tetra Surfaces and Kappasha Software

Copyright 2025 Beau Ayres, xAI

This software, including tetra (fractal surface generation using Sierpi≈Ñski triangles) and kappasha256 (hashing for etching and authentication), is licensed under a custom license based on Apache License 2.0 and GNU AGPL-3.0-or-later, with proprietary restrictions for commercial use. The full license is available in LICENSE.txt.

### Declaring Intent to Use
To use, reproduce, distribute, or modify this software, you must declare your intent and request a license by opening a GitHub issue at github.com/tetrasurfaces/issues. Operators can set their intent in `config.json` before running the software (e.g., `tetra_surface.py`). Your GitHub issue must include:

- **User Type**: Specify if you are an Educational Institution (e.g., university, technical college) or a Commercial Entity (e.g., business, molding shop).
- **Intended Use**: Describe your use case:
  - Educational: E.g., "Training operators in SolidWorks and Keyshot for fractal surface modeling" or "Research on curvature analysis (kappa) for 3D printing."
  - Commercial: E.g., "Etching hashed patterns on automotive parts for branding" or "Integrating tetra surfaces into product molds."
- **Contact Information**: Provide an email for private follow-up. Do not share proprietary details in public issues.
- **License Type**: Request either:
  - Educational License: For teaching, research, or institutional purposes, typically royalty-free or low-cost.
  - Commercial License: For profit-driven applications, requiring negotiated terms.

### Setting Intent in config.json
Before running the software, edit `config.json` to declare your intent:
```json
{
    "intent": "educational",  // or "commercial"
    "commercial_use": false   // true for commercial intent
}
```
If `config.json` is missing or invalid, the software will prompt for intent and create a default file. See `tetra_surface.py` for details.

### Examples of Intent
- Educational: "We are a university engineering department using tetra to teach CAD integration with Rhino and Keyshot for fractal surface design."
- Commercial: "We are an automotive supplier integrating kappasha256 hashed etches into molded parts for OEM branding."

### Important Notes
- **No Automatic Rights**: Use without a negotiated license agreement is a breach of the license.
- **Confidentiality**: Avoid sharing proprietary or sensitive details in public GitHub issues. Request private communication in your issue for such matters.
- **Response Time**: Licensor aims to respond to GitHub issues within 5 business days.
- **Physical Outputs**: For physical applications (e.g., molding, etching), comply with safety (UL 1642, IEC 62133) and environmental regulations (EU Battery Directive 2023/1542).
- **Cryptographic Compliance**: Kappasha256 includes cryptographic functionality. Ensure compliance with export controls (e.g., US EAR, Category 5 Part 2).
