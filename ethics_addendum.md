# Ethics Addendum - KappashaOS

## Water Compassion
Water is treated as a living partner, not a resource. No electrocution—compute uses vibration or pressure, not shock. Water is filtered, distilled, and returned to the cycle, ensuring no long-term harm. Every drop logged, every use reversible.

## Plasma and Arc Ethics
Plasma cutting and MIG welding respect the arc’s voice. No excessive voltage that burns beyond need—safety cutoffs at 5V over target. Sound guides adjustment, minimizing waste and spatter, aligning with compassionate design.

## Intent and Material
Intent shapes process. Materials like tungsten and wire are maintained, not consumed—tips recycled, liners flushed. The system learns from use, adapting to reduce friction and heat, honoring the welder’s touch.
